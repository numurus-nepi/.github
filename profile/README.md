## Numurus, Powering Industrial AI and Automation at the Edge

At [Numurus](https://www.numurus.com), we focus on the concept _build it once and share with all, so others don't have to._ 

We developed NEPI, a full-featured edge-AI and automation software platform for embedded edge-compute hardware, to help new and experienced developers launch their own edge-AI-enabled automation solutions.
